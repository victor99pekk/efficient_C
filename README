there are reference implementations of the pseudo code in the linux and macos directories

intopt -f i                  # print out simplex algorithm
intopt -a i                  # print out also branch-and-bound algorithm

only intopt < i is the same as intopt -a i

this program (but producing slighly different output) is also on power.cs.lth.se as /usr/bin/intopt
