Hello!

Welcome to EDAG01! Here comes some important info about the course!

Lectures are in MA:4 at 10-12 on Wednesdays and Fridays.

The files for the course can be found at: https://web.tresorit.com/l/ptHxi#VM_B0qgLT3fYxkLCCAKp9g

What you need to do to pass the course is to do the labs (see labs.pdf), the assignments rpn, freq, poly, upload intopt to https://forsete.cs.lth.se and an oral exam (any day after you have done the compulsory parts and before Midsummer next year but you can sign up today if you want to).

The Discord-server is at: https://discord.gg/ZTxQ8Qj5WK

If you want to ask me something, I have office hours in Zoom or E:2190 every day. Book at: https://calendly.com/forsete

There you book a time for oral exam as well (you can book it any day and reschedule as needed and take it when all labs are passed.

You can sign up for labs here: https://sam.cs.lth.se/LabsSelectSession?occasionId=886

If you want to work solo, please write that in #solo-laboranter on Discord and sign up with some other person who wants to work solo. You don't need to present the labs together.

I once made youtube videos for the course but they are not officially part of the course since they are not updated.
You can find their playlists here: https://jonasskeppstedt.net/efficient-c

The course book can be found here: https://www.amazon.se/Writing-Efficient-Code-thorough-introduction/dp/1659599202

You can use ssh stilid@power.cs.lth.se to login to the POWER8 machine for the labs.

You must be on a LU network (or VPN) to access the POWER8 machine.

Later, you will be able to upload C-solutions to https://forsete.cs.lth.se and then use the same id and password.

You do not need to use the forsete for the labs.

Have fun!

Jonas
